## How it was built
This project is mostly styling and was done with Scss, the styling is written mobile first.
To make the project more interesting i have different animations, with the help of the Intersection Observer API most element will animate in when scrolled in to view,
i have also made animation for the tabs and the accordion.

## View website
If you want to look at the website then you can download the project as ZIP then extract and then click on the index.html or start with vscode Live Server extension.
